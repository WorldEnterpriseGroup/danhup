- **`Internal Phases:`**

  - **Resume Preparation:** Start by creating or updating your resume to highlight your relevant skills and experiences. Make sure to use a clear, professional format and focus on achievements rather than just job duties.

  - **STAR Creation:** Next, create STAR statements to match the information on your resume. This will help you prepare for interview questions and demonstrate your problem-solving and leadership skills. (for each job you've held, you create one STAR statement. For example: To answer questions such as “tell me a time when _____”)

  - **Mock Up Interviews:** Practice your interview skills by conducting mock interviews with friends, family, or professional recruiters. This will help you become more comfortable with the interview process and improve your confidence.

- **`External Phases:`**

  - **LinkedIn Profile:** Create or update your LinkedIn profile to showcase your professional brand and network with potential clients and recruiters. Make sure to include a professional headshot, a concise summary, and relevant work experience.

  - **Applying for Jobs:** Search for job openings that match your skills and interests and apply for them through LinkedIn or other job boards.

  - **Actual Interviews:** If you are selected for an interview, prepare thoroughly and make sure to show up on time and dressed appropriately. During the interview, use the STAR method to answer questions, and ask relevant questions about the company and the role to show your interest.

  - **Follow-up:** After the interview, send a thank-you note to the interviewer and follow up on the status of your application. This will show your professionalism and help you stay top of mind.
