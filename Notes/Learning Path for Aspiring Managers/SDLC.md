# Understanding Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a framework that outlines the various stages involved in developing software applications. It encompasses planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software products. Understanding the SDLC is crucial for software developers, project managers, and business analysts to ensure successful software development projects.

The SDLC consists of several phases, including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase involves specific activities, deliverables, and stakeholders, and the process is iterative and cyclical.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the SDLC, beginners can refer to various resources such as online tutorials, blogs, and videos. Here is recommended video resource:

## Notes:
For making any application we need to understand SDLC. It involves phases to initiate software production based on client requirements.
There are six phases of SDLC of how software is developed:

1. **Planning:** Agreement of terms and condition between clients and development team.
- Purpose of application
- Details about end-users
- Key Elements like format and attributes
- Overall UI design of the software
2. **Requirement Analysis**
- Information about each element of design
- Validating the installation
- Calibrating the security protocols and risk analysis
- Software Requirement Specification Document (SRS)
3. Design
- Devisse the system design following SRS
- Check Fesibility with requirements
- Design document specification (DDS documents)
- Review
4. Implemetation
- Developers start writing the code using the languages
- Actual Implementation of the software product
- Developments tools like compilers and debuggers
- Implement code
5. Testing
- Deployed in multiple test environment to check the functioning
- Testing team may find errors or bugs
- Continued till the system until the software is stable and works per requirements
6. Deployement
- Ready for deployement and consumers
- Development team will setup installation link for the users
- Debugging the application is done on regular basis
- Regular updates with enhanced features
